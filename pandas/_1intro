Pandas is a Python library used for data analysis and data manipulation.

It provides data structures like:

1.Series → a one-dimensional labeled array (like a column in Excel).

2.DataFrame → a two-dimensional labeled data structure (like an Excel sheet or SQL table).

Pandas is widely used in data science, machine learning, and analytics because it makes handling tabular 

data very easy.
